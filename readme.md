## AIGC Knickknack
Here I will create some interesting AIGC projects, each directory contains a project. If you like it, please give me a star, thanks

There are mainly four kinds of projects, all of them are written using pytorch lightning, I'll keep updating

### 1. Generating Image
- [use VAE to generate handwriting numbers](VAE_MNIST)
- [use CVAE to generate handwriting numbers conditionally](CVAE_MNIST)
- [use VAE to generate anime faces](VAE_ANIME)
- [use GAN to generate handwriting numbers](GAN_MNIST)
- [use CGAN to generate handwriting numbers conditionally](CGAN_MNIST)
- [use DCGAN to generate anime faces](GAN_ANIME)
- [use VAE&GAN to generate anime faces](VAE_GAN)
- [use DDPM to generate handwriting numbers](DDPM_MNIST)
- [use DDPM to generate anime faces](DDPM_ANIME)
- [use DDIM to generate anime faces](DDIM_ANIME)

### 2. Generating Text
- [use BERT to generate Chinese Poetry](BERT_Poetry)

### 3. Text to Image

### 4. Image to Text
